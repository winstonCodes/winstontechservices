I"M<p>I’m happy to mark the launch of my new consulting website. I have been contemplating starting this business for a while and now I am bringing my expertise to small businesses looking to increase online conversions, or to simply have an online presence in general.</p>

<p>2020 has shown us that having an online presence is critical for small businesses to succeed. Even if the business is selling a product or a service that is delivered in person, facilitating communication with potential clients and/or customers without physical contact is not only smart, it is responsible.</p>
