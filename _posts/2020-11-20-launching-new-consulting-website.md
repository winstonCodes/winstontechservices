I'm happy to mark the launch of my new consulting website. I have been contemplating starting this business for a while and now I am bringing my expertise to small businesses looking to increase online conversions, or to simply have an online presence in general. 

2020 has shown us that having an online presence is critical for small businesses to succeed. Even if the business is selling a product or a service that is delivered in person, facilitating communication with potential clients and/or customers without physical contact is not only smart, it is responsible.
